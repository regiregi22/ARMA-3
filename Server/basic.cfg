MaxMsgSend = 512;    // Maximum number of packets (aggregate messages) that can be sent in one simulation cycle ("frame"). Increasing this value can decrease lag on high upload bandwidth servers. Put 512 if it is specially fast connection.
MaxSizeGuaranteed = 512;    // Maximum size (payload) of guaranteed packet in bytes (without headers). Small messages are packed to larger packets (aggregate messages). Guaranteed packets (aggregate messages) are used for non-repetitive events like shooting.
MaxSizeNonguaranteed = 256;    // Maximum size (payload) of non-guaranteed packet in bytes (without headers). Small messages are packed to larger packets (aggregate messages). Non-guaranteed packets (aggregate messages) are used for repetitive updates like soldier or vehicle position. Increasing this value may improve bandwidth requirement, but it may increase lag.
MinBandwidth = 2621440;    // For 25 Mbps. Bandwidth the server is guaranteed to have (in bps). This value helps server to estimate bandwidth available. Increasing it to too optimistic values can increase lag and CPU load, as too many messages will be sent but discarded.
MaxBandwidth = 1048576000;    // For 10Gbps maximum never achieved. Bandwidth the server is guaranteed to never have (in bps). This value helps the server to estimate bandwidth available. Do NOT set this too high or your Arma server will simulate ego-ddos
MinErrorToSend = 0.001;    // Minimal error to send updates across network. Using a smaller value can make units observed by binoculars or sniper rifle to move smoother at the trade off of increased network traffic.
MinErrorToSendNear = 0.01;    // Minimal error to send updates across network for near units. Using larger value can reduce traffic sent for near units. Used to control client to server traffic as well.
MaxCustomFileSize = 1310720;    // Users with custom face or custom sound larger than this size are kicked when trying to connect. Set to 0 to disable.
