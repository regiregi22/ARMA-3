MaxMsgSend = 384;    // Maximum number of packets (aggregate messages) that can be sent in one simulation cycle ("frame"). Increasing this value can decrease lag on high upload bandwidth servers.

Non-guaranteed packets (aggregate messages) are used for repetitive updates like soldier or vehicle position. Increasing this value may improve bandwidth requirement, but it may increase lag.
MinBandwidth = 2621440;    // For 25 Mbps. Bandwidth the server is guaranteed to have (in bps). This value helps server to estimate bandwidth available. Increasing it to too optimistic values can increase lag and CPU load, as too many messages will be sent but discarded.

MinErrorToSend = 0.001;    // Minimal error to send updates across network. Using a smaller value can make units observed by binoculars or sniper rifle to move smoother at the trade off of increased network traffic.
MinErrorToSendNear = 0.01;    // Minimal error to send updates across network for near units. Using larger value can reduce traffic sent for near units. Used to control client to server traffic as well.

Only use in the case your router or ISP enforces lower packet size and you have connectivity issues with the game. Desync might happen if used MaxSizeGuaranteed/MaxSizeNonguaranteed values over the maxPacketSize.
