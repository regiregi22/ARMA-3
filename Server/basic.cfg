MaxMsgSend = 1024;    // Maximum number of packets (aggregate messages) that can be sent in one simulation cycle ("frame"). Increasing this value can decrease lag on high upload bandwidth servers. For 128 players and value set to "128" (and 1300 bytes per packet), it is 160 mbit/s. So set to 256 means 320 mbit/s. So, for 32 players and a 1024 value, means 320 mbit/s. All of this multiplied by 50 cycles per second, so numbers bigger than MaxBandwidth.
MaxSizeGuaranteed = 512;    // Maximum size (payload) of guaranteed packet in bytes (without headers). Small messages are packed to larger packets (aggregate messages). Guaranteed packets (aggregate messages) are used for non-repetitive events like shooting.
MaxSizeNonguaranteed = 256;    // Maximum size (payload) of non-guaranteed packet in bytes (without headers). Small messages are packed to larger packets (aggregate messages). Non-guaranteed packets (aggregate messages) are used for repetitive updates like soldier or vehicle position. Increasing this value may improve bandwidth requirement, but it may increase lag.
MinBandwidth = 1310720;    // Default x10. Bandwidth the server is guaranteed to have (in bps). This value helps server to estimate bandwidth available. Increasing it to too optimistic values can increase lag and CPU load, as too many messages will be sent but discarded.
MaxBandwidth = 1048576000;    // For 10Gbps maximum never achieved. Bandwidth the server is guaranteed to never have (in bps). This value helps the server to estimate bandwidth available. Do NOT set this too high or your Arma server will simulate ego-ddos. SUMA says: "The ideal factor is: leave it at the default unless you really see something goes wrong. The built-in bandwidth estimation is built on a packet-pair probing QoS, which has shown to be very reliable on the internet as we know it today."
MinErrorToSend = 0.0005;    // Minimal error to send updates across network. Using a smaller value can make units observed by binoculars or sniper rifle to move smoother at the trade off of increased network traffic. Dwarden confirms in a forum that "MinErrorToSend default value was changed to 0.001 since 1.60 and new setting was introduced: MinErrorToSendNear" 
MinErrorToSendNear = 0.005;    // Minimal error to send updates across network for near units. Using larger value can reduce traffic sent for near units. Used to control client to server traffic as well.
MaxCustomFileSize = 0;    // Users with custom face or custom sound larger than this size are kicked when trying to connect. Set to 0 to disable. Or 1310720 for an acceptable value.
